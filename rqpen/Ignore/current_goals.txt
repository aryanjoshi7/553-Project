  Include qicd implementation of lasso so it can be used with warm starts from the cross validation function 
	Ben: This is done though I’m holding off on figuring out how to implement warm starts as the easy approaches I’ve tried are not working”
  Update qicd programs for weighted regression?  Not done, but not that important

2.       Update rq.lasso.fit to use shortrq functions (shortrq functions require a single lambda. rq.lasso.fit needs to be able to use multiple lambdas as it is called by functions such as rq.group.fit and rq.nc.fit
that send it different values for lambda)
4.       Incorporate qicd implementation into rq.lasso.fit for warm starts with cross validation function (tried but got strange results, holding off for now)
