rq.group.pen            Fits quantile regression models using a group
                        penalized objective function.
rq.group.pen.cv         Performs cross validation for a group penalty.
rq.pen                  Fit a quantile regression model using a
                        penalized quantile loss function.
rq.pen.cv               Does k-folds cross validation for rq.pen. If
                        multiple values of a are specified then does a
                        grid based search for best value of lambda and
                        a.
